# Seattle Municipal Solid Waste 2000-2019

This dataset was curated for Data Curation 1 (LIS 545), a course offered by the iSchool at the University of Washington as part of their MLIS program. It contains data [provided by Seattle Public Utilities](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SPU/Documents/Recycling_Rate_Report_2019.pdf) (SPU) about their Municipal Solid Waste program (MSW), including tonnage of MSW generated, disposed (sent to landfill), and recycled; recycling rate per year; population size of the city; and year-over-year (YOY) comparisons of these metrics. The data span 20 years, from 2000-2019.

The dataset consists of 3 CSV files, one for each MSW waste stream: Residential, Commercial, and Self-Haul. Year, Seattle's population, and the population's YOY change are duplicated across all 3 files to increase interpretability. If the dataset were instead structured as a relational database, there would be a separate table for population and all tables could be joined on the year.

This dataset is relevant to researchers who are interested in assessing the effectiveness of urban recycling initiatives in a large, growing city. Of particular note is Seattleâ€™s ability to grow in population size by over 30% between 2000-2019 while maintaining a relatively stable amount of MSW generated over the same period.

## Naming Conventions
Filenames follow the convention:
```
seattle_msw_{stream}.csv
```
where `{stream}` denotes the waste stream the data refer to, which should be one of `commercial`, `residential`, or `selfhaul`.
